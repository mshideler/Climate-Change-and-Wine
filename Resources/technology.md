# **Group 2 Technology Overview**

## **Data Cleaning and Analysis**

In the data cleaning and analysis phase we will be using the Pandas library to clean our data and do an exploratory analysis. We will use additional Python libraries like SciPy or NumPy if necessary to complete any further analyses. 

## **Machine Learning**

For the Machine Learning model instance, we will use the Python libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. SKLearn will be used for the  StandardScaler, and TrainTestSplit modules. While we will use TensorFlow for the Keras module to compile our model before training. 

## **Database Storage**

for storage of our datasets we will be using an instance of PostGresSQL DB hosted on and connected to Amazon Web Services. 

## **Dashboard**

To build the framework of our Dashboard we will be using JavaScript ES6+ and HTML to build the framework of our Dashboard. Our Dashboard will be hosted and served on Git Pages in order to provide easy, open access, and a reliable server instance.
